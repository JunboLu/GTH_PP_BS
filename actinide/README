              Actinide GTH pseudopotentials and MOLOPT basis sets README

We build the GTH pseudopotentials and MOLOPT basis sets for actinide series. If you have any
question, please send problems and feedback to lujunbo15@gmail.com and junli@tsinghua.edu.cn.
If you want to use these pseudopotentials and basis sets, we recomend that you could read our
literature at first:

There are medium-core and large-core GTH pseudopotentials and companion basis sets for actinide
series. These parameters are both in CP2K format. The definions of medium-core and large-core
pseudopotentials are rather different. Let us take uranium atom as example:

-------------------------------------------------------------
 Core-type         Core          Semi-core         Valence
-------------------------------------------------------------
Medium-core     [Xe]4f^14     5d^10/6s^2/6p^6  5f^3/6d^1/7s^2
-------------------------------------------------------------
Large-core   [Xe]4f^14/5d^10     6s^2/6p^6     5f^3/6d^1/7s^2
-------------------------------------------------------------

It is clear to find that 5d^10 is treated as semi-core state in medium-core pseudopotential.
When users use medium-core pseudopotentials, larger cutoff (>600 Ry) is safer. Different from 
lanthanides, we use the same Gaussian exponents for s, p, d, f and g states in basis sets. It
is mainly because 4f orbital is more compact than 5f orbital.

The medium-core GTH pseudopotentials are in An-PP-M file, and companion basis sets are in An-BS-M
file. The large-core GTH pseudopotentials are in An-PP-L file, and companion basis sets are in 
An-BS-L file. We also present large-core pseudopotentials of uranium with different r^loc.

Enjoy using actinide pseudopotential and basis sets!
