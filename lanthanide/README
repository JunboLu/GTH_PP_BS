              Lanthanide GTH pseudopotentials and MOLOPT basis set README

We build GTH pseudopotentials and MOLOPT basis sets for lanthanide series. If you have any
question, please send problems and feedback to lujunbo15@gmail.com and roger.rousseau@pnnl.gov.
If you want to use our pseudopotentials and basis sets, please read our literature at first:
J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2019, 15, 5987âˆ’5997.

GTH pseudopotential is an explicit seperable pseudopotential. This pseudopotential is a little
different from quantum chemistry pseudopotential. It is used in CP2K, CPMD and ABINIT programs.
For our lanthanide GTH pseudopotentials, we adopt large-core pseudopotential from La to Ga,
and medium-core pseuopotential from Tb to Lu. When users use these pseudopotential, please
be careful to set cutoff in CP2K. For late lanthanide using medium-core pseudopotential, larger
cutoff (>500 Ry) is safer. The MOLOPT basis sets format is a little different from basis
sets of d-block. We use the same Gaussian exponents for s, p and d states, and uncontract f 
states. This is mainly due to the extremely localized 4f orbital.

The original GTH pseudopotentials are in GTH directory. The final version GTH pseudopotentials
and basis sets are in final_PP_BS directory. Users can copy GTH pseudopotentials and basis sets
in final_PP_BS directory. The format is CP2K format. For other softwares, users need to
change its format.

Enjoy using lanthanide pseudopotentials and basis sets!
