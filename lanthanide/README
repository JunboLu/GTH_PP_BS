              Lanthanide GTH pseudopotential and MOLOPT basis set README

We build the GTH pseudopotential and MOLOPT basis sets for lanthanide series. If you have any
question, please send problems and feedback to lujunbo15@gmail.com and roger.rousseau@pnnl.gov.
If you want to use our pseudopotential and basis sets, please read our literature at first:
J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2019, 15, 5987âˆ’5997.

GTH pseudopotential is an explicit seperable pseudopotential. This pseudopotential is a little
different from quantum chemistry pseudopotential. It is used in CP2K, CPMD and QE programs.
For our lanthanides GTH pseudopotential, we adopt large-core pseudopotential from La to Ga,
and medium-core pseuopotential from Tb to Lu. When users use these pseudopotential, please
be careful to set cutoff in CP2K. For late lanthanide using medium-core pseudopotential, larger
cutoff (>500 Ry) is safer. The MOLOPT basis set format is a little different from basis
set of d-block. We use the same Gaussian exponents for s, p and d states, and uncontract f 
states. This is mainly due to the extremely localized 4f orbital.

The original GTH pseudopotential is in GTH directory. The final version GTH pseudopotential
and basis sets are in final_PP_BS directory. Users can copy the GTH pseudopotential and basis
set in final_PP_BS directory. The format is CP2K format. For other softwares, users need to
change its format.

Enjoy using these pseudopotential and basis sets!
